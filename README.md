A comprehensive curated whiteboard of test concepts and methodologies to expand knowledge of testing.

* [A/B testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing) - a controlled experiment with two variants A and B in web analytics. It is a form of "two-sample hypothesis testing" as used in the field of statistics. In web/mobile user experience design, the goal of A/B testing is to identify changes to web pages that increase or maximize an outcome of interest. https://vwo.com/ab-testing/
* [Model-based testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-based_testing) - automatic generation of software test procedures, using models of system requirements and behavior. Models can be used to represent the desired behavior of a system under test (SUT), or to represent testing strategies and a test environment. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee620469.aspx
* [Exploratory testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_testing) - a way to test the application by exploring it to find what does the application do and not etc. In exploratory testing, test planning, analysis, design and test execution are all done together and instantly. It completely depends upon the testers thought process. We all do some sort of exploratory testing in our day to day life. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj620911(v=vs.120).aspx
* [Ad hoc testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc_testing) - an informal testing type with an aim to break the system. Ad hoc testing does not follow any structured way of testing and it is randomly done on any part of application without any test cases or any business requirement document. Main aim of this testing is to find defects by random checking. It can be achieved with the testing technique called Error Guessing. https://www.guru99.com/adhoc-testing.html
